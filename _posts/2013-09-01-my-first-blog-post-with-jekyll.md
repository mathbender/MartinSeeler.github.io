###Hello world !###
 This is Nur Muhammad Shafiullah(aka Mahi), and here is my new blog, complete with jekyll and github pages and everything :P

And again, who am I? Okay, you already know that I am [Nur Muhammad Shafiullah](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nur+Muhammad+Shafiullah). What you can also know about me is I am a student from Dhaka College, Dhaka, Bangladesh, I live in Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh, and am 17 y/o.

So, why am I different from others? Well, this is actually where this blog comes in, and this is where you will be able to see my day to day random rumbling. I hoped to say a little more about myself, who I am and what I do usually, but on second thought, nope, not today.

So bye, I hope I will be able to update at least this blog of mine quite regularly.

Good night,</br>
Mahi
