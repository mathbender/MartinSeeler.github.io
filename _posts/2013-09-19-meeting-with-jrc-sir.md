##The man who can make 75+ years age look non-horrible.

However you see it, old age is nothing desirable to someone as "young and energetic" as myself. Still then, it makes you worry, what would happen when you lose all your strength? Well, today, JRC sir made it look like old age is nearly nothing - which is a great thing to accomplish (and I think that quite much expresses how awesome he is). I wanted to write so many stuff about it, but I can't, which is painful.

Chemistry exam is postponed till 28th or something, a real pain in the ass.

I am feeling too sleepy to write anymore. I really hope I can update this blog regularly from now (though I know that I can't).

Good night,<br>
Mahi.
